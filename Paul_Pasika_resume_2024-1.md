  ***Nominated for Sysadmin of the year 2007:***

*"For five years, our company was a structureless jungle of makeshift security and shoddy infrastructure. Hell, we were even forced to host our web applications in a managed hosting facility for lack of confidence and expertise. We were more than a little embarrassed by this, and when we finally decided to hire a sysadmin, we spent more time making excuses and apologizing than anything else. Despite that, "Evil Paul" took the job and turned it all around within a few months. We now have actual security, proper backups, a VPN, DNS servers (we'd pathetically been managing all our internal DNS via shared hosts files). Rather than stumbling over cables, we now we have time to debate the benefits of vegetarianism, or whether or not it's sanitary to not wear shoes to the bathroom." - Paul Brockmeyer, Owner Catylist, Inc.*
