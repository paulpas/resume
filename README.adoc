*_Nominated for Sysadmin of the year 2007:_* +
_"For five years, our company was a structureless jungle of makeshift
security and shoddy infrastructure. Hell, we were even forced to host
our web applications in a managed hosting facility for lack of
confidence and expertise. We were more than a little embarrassed by
this, and when we finally decided to hire a sysadmin, we spent more time
making excuses and apologizing than anything else. Despite that, "Evil
Paul" took the job and turned it all around within a few months. We now
have actual security, proper backups, a VPN, DNS servers (we'd
pathetically been managing all our internal DNS via shared hosts files).
Rather than stumbling over cables, we now we have time to debate the
benefits of vegetarianism, or whether or not it's sanitary to not wear
